# Vauxr Roadmap

---

## Planned

Features grouped by theme. No ordering assigned.

### Conversation Quality
- **Follow-up mode** — server sends `follow_up` flag; device stays in listening state automatically after a response
- **Interruption** — wake word fires during playback to abort and start a new turn; full-duplex + AEC via ESP-SR AFE (ESP32-S3 supports simultaneous I2S TX/RX, AEC built into the same AFE framework as VAD)

### Device Management
- **Device management REST API** — `/api/devices` endpoints for creating, listing, renaming, and revoking devices; each device gets its own unique token at registration. Replaces the single shared `DEVICE_TOKEN` `.env` bootstrap with proper per-device identity, auditability, and rotation.
- **Device management web UI** — section in the existing web-client for adding, naming, and revoking devices via the browser; shows connection state, last-seen time, and per-device token management. Pairs with the REST API above and replaces the earlier "device pairing web UI" idea with a full device lifecycle surface.

### Home Assistant Integration
- **Vauxr STT/TTS providers for HA** — HA sees stable "Vauxr STT" and "Vauxr TTS" entities that speak the Vauxr WS protocol under the hood. HA users can route their voice pipeline through Vauxr without ever exposing Whisper/Piper TCP ports directly. Whisper/Piper TCP endpoints are internal to the Vauxr stack — HA integration goes through the Vauxr protocol, not around it. Lets HA users benefit from Vauxr's backend flexibility while keeping HA's conversation agent and intent system for automations.

### Provider Abstraction
- **STTProvider / TTSProvider extension system** — pluggable provider interface so Whisper and Piper become one option among many. Swap in Deepgram, ElevenLabs, Groq Whisper, Coqui, or any other STT/TTS backend without touching device firmware or the WS protocol. Keeps the device-facing protocol stable while the backend evolves.

### Device Context & Voice Formatting
- **Server-side device registry** (`devices.json` keyed by `device_id`, fields: `name`, `voice: bool`)
- **Session preamble injection** — on first turn of each session, server prepends hidden context to `chat.send` with device name and voice formatting rules (no emojis, no markdown, concise spoken sentences)

### Transcription Accuracy
- **Conversation context for Whisper** — pass recent conversation history as an initial prompt to the Whisper API (`initial_prompt` field); primes the model with relevant vocabulary, proper nouns, and topic context from the current session, improving accuracy especially for domain-specific terms and follow-up questions

### Audio Quality
- **Sibilance / hiss on "s" sounds** — TTS output has white noise on sibilants (sounds like "sh"); needs investigation: Piper voice model selection, sample rate / bit depth in the audio pipeline, MP3 encoding settings

### Multi-Device & Proximity Detection
- **Wake word dedup** — when multiple devices hear the wake word simultaneously, server arbitrates: devices include a confidence score with the wake event, server holds a ~500ms dedup window, highest-confidence device wins (closest device naturally tends to win), losers receive a `cancel` frame to abort listening; prevents duplicate STT submissions and overlapping spoken responses

### Server-Initiated Control *(architecture TBD — likely shared HTTP server)*
- **Audio stream playback** — server sends a `device.play` control frame over WS containing a URL; device connects to the URL and streams + plays the audio as it downloads; enables music playback, internet radio, audio clips, or any audio source reachable by the device
- **Stop playback** — server sends a `device.stop` control frame to interrupt any currently playing audio (TTS or stream)
- ~~**Push TTS / announce** — `POST /api/devices/{id}/announce` synthesizes text via Piper and streams as `0x03` push audio frames to device; enables cron jobs, heartbeats, and proactive agent alerts to speak through the device~~ ✅
- ~~**Device control from OpenClaw** — `POST /api/devices/{id}/command` sends a `device.control` JSON frame (e.g. `set_volume`, `mute`, `reboot`); enables voice commands like "set the volume to 10" to actually change device state~~ ✅
- **Device queries / telemetry** — bidirectional: server can request data from the device and await a response (e.g. "what's your battery level?"); device responds with a `device.response` frame; server surfaces the answer back to OpenClaw

### OpenClaw Channel Plugin (`vauxr-openclaw`)
- ~~Optional plugin for deeper OpenClaw integration~~ ✅
- **Relay mode**: plugin opens outbound WS from local OpenClaw to Vauxr Cloud — no port forwarding needed, private local OpenClaw works with Vauxr Cloud
- Device appears in OpenClaw `/status`, `/pair` command support

### Security
- **WSS (TLS) transport** — currently using plain `ws://`; production deployments should use `wss://`; needs TLS cert handling on the server side and `esp_tls` on the ESP32 (ESP-IDF has built-in support)
- **Certificate validation** — device should verify server cert; for self-hosted setups, support custom CA bundle baked into firmware
- **Token rotation** — per-device bearer tokens should be rotatable without re-pairing
