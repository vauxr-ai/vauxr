**Vauxr is an open protocol for voice assistants** — a hardware-agnostic, ecosystem-agnostic standard for connecting microphones, speakers, and wake-word devices to any voice backend.

Voice is becoming a natural interface for AI, but today it's locked in — Alexa only works with Amazon, Google Assistant only with Google, Home Assistant voice only with HA, and ESPHome devices only with HA. Vauxr is an open wire protocol any device and any agent provider can implement (think MQTT for messaging, or USB for peripherals): speak Vauxr on the device and on the server, swap STT, TTS, or agent providers freely, and nothing needs re-flashing or rewriting to move between them.

## This repository

This repo is the **reference server implementation** — a self-hosted Docker stack that speaks the Vauxr protocol and ships with [Wyoming](https://github.com/rhasspy/wyoming)-compatible Whisper (STT) and Piper (TTS) out of the box. Use it as-is, or as a blueprint for your own implementation.

## How it works

```
Device (mic) → vauxr → Whisper (STT) → LLM backend → Piper (TTS) → Device (speaker)
```

Any device that speaks the Vauxr WS protocol can connect. The HTTP API (`/api/devices`) lets your backend push announcements to devices and send control commands without a voice turn.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo and copy the example env file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vauxr-ai/vauxr.git
cd vauxr
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit `.env` — only one value required:

```env
DEVICE_TOKEN=your-device-shared-secret
```

3. Start the stack:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Devices connect to `ws://your-server-ip:8765`. HTTP API at `http://your-server-ip:8080`.

## Connecting to OpenClaw

The recommended path is the [vauxr-openclaw](https://github.com/vauxr-ai/vauxr-openclaw) channel plugin, installed from [ClaWHub](https://clawhub.ai):

```bash
openclaw plugins install clawhub:@vauxr/openclaw
```

The plugin wires OpenClaw to your Vauxr server and exposes device announcements and controls as agent tools. See the [vauxr-openclaw README](https://github.com/vauxr-ai/vauxr-openclaw) for configuration.

## Connecting to other backends

Vauxr is backend-agnostic. If you're not using OpenClaw, connect your own LLM or agent service to the Vauxr WS protocol — see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for the protocol spec.

## HTTP API

All endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <DEVICE_TOKEN>`.

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/devices` | List connected devices and state |
| `POST` | `/api/devices/{id}/announce` | Push TTS announcement to a device |
| `POST` | `/api/devices/{id}/command` | Send control command (`set_volume`, `mute`, `unmute`, `reboot`) |

A Postman collection is included at `postman/vauxr.postman_collection.json`.

## Architecture

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full system design and protocol spec, and [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for what's planned.
